# software project app
 
During our second year we were tasked to develop an application in groups of five.
The app we decided to develop was inspired by the need for a better voting application
during the introduction of a new student council at Pearson. Our team wanted to improve the
interface and interaction of the existing system, as well as fix the problems identified
by students that voted.
